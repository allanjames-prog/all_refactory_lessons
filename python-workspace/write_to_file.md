## 📁 WRITING TO A FILE USING PYTHON  

### ✅ Writing, Appending, and Reading a File

```python
import os

# Function to write data to the file (Overwrites existing content)
def write_to_file():
  with open("myfile.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is the text I intend to write in my file.\n")
    file.write("This is the second line.\n")
    file.write("This text overides what has been found there.")
  print("Data written to 'myfile.txt' successfully.")

# Function to append data to the file (Does not overwrite)
def append_to_file():
  with open("myfile.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Writing to a Text File in Python Python provides built-in functions to handle file operations like reading and writing. Below is a well-explained example of how to write to a .txt file in Python.\n")
  print("New data appended to 'myfile.txt'.")

# Function to read and display file contents
def read_file():
  if os.path.exists("myfile.txt"):
    with open("myfile.txt", "r") as file:
      content = file.read()
      print("\n=== File Contents ===")
      print(content)
  else:
    print("Error: 'myfile.txt' does not exist!")

# Main Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
  write_to_file() 
  append_to_file() 
  read_file()
```

### ✍️ Writing to a File

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Open a file in write mode
file.write("Hello, this is the first line of text.\n")
file.write("This is the second line.\n")
file.close()
```

---

### ➕ Appending to a File

```python
file = open("example.txt", "a")  # Open in append mode
file.write("This is an additional line.\n")
file.close()
```

---

### 📜 Writing Multiple Lines at Once

```python
lines = ["First line.\n", "Second line.\n", "Third line.\n"]
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:  
  file.writelines(lines)
```

---

### 📂 Using File Paths

```python
file_path = "C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/myfile.txt"
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    file.write("Writing to a file in a specific location.")
```

---

### 💡 Other Ways to Define File Paths

```python
# file_path = "C:\\Users\\james\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Workspace\\my-text.txt"
# file_path = "C:/Users/james/OneDrive/Documents/Workspace/my-text.txt"
```

### 🧾 Writing Large Text to File

```python
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
  file.write("Writing to a file in a specific location.")
  file.write("""Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development. It was created in 2001 by a group of software developers who wanted a better approach to software development than the rigid, document-heavy methods used at the time.

Structure of the Agile Manifesto
It consists of:

Four core values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
Twelve principles, which emphasize continuous delivery, customer satisfaction, adaptability, face-to-face communication, self-organizing teams, and sustainable development.

An Agile Manifesto should be concise, values-driven, and principle-based to guide how teams work in a flexible and efficient manner.

Scrum Framework
Scrum is a lightweight, iterative, and flexible Agile framework designed to help teams deliver value incrementally and adapt quickly to changes. It is built on three key pillars:

Transparency – Work and progress should be visible to everyone.
Inspection – Frequent assessment of progress to detect any deviations.
Adaptation – Adjustments made based on feedback and learning.

Scrum Team Roles:
Product Owner – Defines priorities and ensures the team delivers maximum value.
Scrum Master – Facilitates the Scrum process, removes blockers, and coaches the team.
Development Team – Cross-functional group that builds the product.

Scrum Artifacts:
Product Backlog – A prioritized list of work (features, bugs, enhancements).
Sprint Backlog – A subset of backlog items selected for the sprint.
Increment – The completed and potentially shippable product at the end of a sprint.

Applying Scrum Activities
Sprint Planning – The team selects work from the backlog for a sprint (typically 2-4 weeks).
Daily Scrum (Stand-up Meeting) – A 15-minute meeting to sync up, identify roadblocks, and plan the day.
Sprint Execution – The team works on tasks in the Sprint Backlog.
Sprint Review – The team presents the work done to stakeholders for feedback.
Sprint Retrospective – The team reflects on the sprint, discussing improvements for the next cycle.

By following these steps, Scrum ensures continuous improvement, faster delivery, and higher adaptability to customer needs.

### 🕒 Logging Events to a File

```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_event(event_message):
  with open("log.txt", "a") as log_file:
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    log_file.write(f"[{timestamp}] {event_message}\n")

# Example Usage
log_event("User logged in.")
log_event("File upload failed due to size limit.")
```

---

### 👤 Saving User Data

```python
def save_user_data(name, age, email):
  with open("users.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Email: {email}\n")
    file.write(f"\n")

# Example Usage
save_user_data("John Doe", 25, "john@example.com")
save_user_data("Jane Smith", 30, "jane.smith@email.com")
```

---

### 🌡️ Logging Sensor Data

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime

def log_sensor_data():
  temperature = round(random.uniform(20, 30), 2)
  humidity = round(random.uniform(30, 60), 2)
  
  with open("sensor_data.txt", "a") as file:
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    file.write(f"{timestamp}, Temperature: {temperature}°C, Humidity: {humidity}%\n")

# Example Usage
log_sensor_data()
```

---

### 📊 Generating a Sales Report

```python
def generate_report(sales_data):
  with open("sales_report.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("=== Sales Report ===\n")
    file.write("Product | Quantity | Price\n")
    for product, (qty, price) in sales_data.items():
      file.write(f"{product} | {qty} | ${price:.2f}\n")

# Example Usage
sales = {
  "Laptop": (5, 1200.00),
  "Mouse": (15, 25.99),
  "Keyboard": (10, 45.50)
}
generate_report(sales)
```

def add_task(task):
  with open("todo.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(f"- {task}\n")

# Example Usage
add_task("Finish Python project")
add_task("Prepare for the meeting at 3 PM")
```

## Writing to other file types.

Writing to other types of files like `.md`, `.html`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, etc., in Python is **almost the same** as writing to `.txt` files. The main difference is in **what content you write**, based on the **file format's structure or purpose**.

Here’s how you can write to some common file types:

---

### ✅ 1. **Writing to a Markdown (`.md`) File**
Markdown files are just text files with special formatting (like `#` for headings).

```python
with open("README.md", "w") as file:
    file.write("# Project Title\n")
    file.write("This is a description of the project.\n")
    file.write("## Features\n")
    file.write("- Easy to use\n- Lightweight\n")
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Writing to an HTML (`.html`) File**

```python
html_content = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>My Web Page</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
"""

with open("index.html", "w") as file:
    file.write(html_content)
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Writing to a CSV (`.csv`) File**

Use Python's built-in `csv` module.

```python
import csv

data = [["Name", "Age"], ["Alice", 25], ["Bob", 30]]

with open("people.csv", "w", newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Writing to a JSON (`.json`) File**

Use the `json` module to write dictionaries/lists.

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "email": "alice@example.com"}

with open("data.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Writing to an XML (`.xml`) File**

You can manually write XML structure or use libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.

```python
xml_data = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
<person>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <age>30</age>
</person>
"""

with open("person.xml", "w") as file:
    file.write(xml_data)
```

---

### 🔁 Same Syntax, Different Format
The **`with open(filename, mode)`** pattern works the same across all file types. Just make sure the **content** matches the **expected structure** of the file type.
